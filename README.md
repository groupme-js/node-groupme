### About

Inspired by [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js), `node-groupme` aims to replace the obsolete [groupme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/groupme) package with a modern, object-oriented, intuitive approach to interacting with the GroupMe API.

### Getting Started

```
git clone git@github.com:groupme-js/node-groupme.git
npm i
npm run prepare
```

`npm run prepare` sets up [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) pre-commit hooks, which will auto format and run eslint on your staged files locally.
